// Objective: Write an Ether staking smart contract that allows users to stake Ether for a specified period.

// Requirements:
// Users should be able to stake Ether by sending a transaction to the contract.
// The contract should record the staking time for each user.
// Implement a reward mechanism where users earn rewards based on how long they have staked their Ether.
// The rewards should be proportional to the duration of the stake.
// Users should be able to withdraw both their staked Ether and the earned rewards after the staking period ends.
// Ensure the contract is secure, especially in handling usersâ€™ funds and calculating rewards.
